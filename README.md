# indian-names-ml
A machine learning classifier that identifies if a given name is Indian or not.

## How It Works
The algorithm mainly uses the Naive Bayes algorithm (which uses Bayes' Rule) to consider the probability of a 
given name being "Indian". The datasets include a set of Indian names as well as set of Spanish surnames (see Acknowledgments)

### Naive Bayes
Below is the Naive Bayes calculation, where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=I"> is the event that a name is Indian and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=S">
is the event that a given substring appears in a name.

The original idea was to consider all the individual characters in a name and the probability
that it appears in an Indian name. However, this can lead to issues where two names (one is Indian,
the other is not) have the exact same characters, but different spellings. Consider the 
following case:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ctext%7BA%20%7D%5Ctext%7BR%20%7D%5Ctext%7BU%20%7D%5Ctext%7BL%20%7D" />
<br />

<br />

The solution to the above case would be to consider the position of each character
relative to other characters. For example, instead of taking into account the set
of letters {A, R, U, L}, we can instead consider the set of three-letter substrings 
present in the name, i.e {ARU, RUL}. The name RAUL would be considered as {RAU, AUL}.
This approach also accounts for duplicate letters and their positions (such as {AAN} vs {ANA}).
<br />
<br />
*This is for illustrative purposes only. The actual spelling of 'Ra√∫l' contains an accent over the 'u'
which would be successful recognized separately by the algorithm.


## Limitations
One of the limitations of this project is that there are only two types of names being considered.
When given a name that is not from any of the two classifications, the algorithm is likely to return
an incorrect label.

Another limitation is that the number of Indian names in the dataset is rather small
(about 4000) compared to the number of Spanish surnames (about 15000). This bias results in
a skewed probability, namely <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BP%7D%28I%29" /> and
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BP%7D%28%5Cbar%20I%29" />. This can
be remedied by adding more data to the dataset.
## Use Cases
This algorithm could be adapted for larger purposes. The most immediate would be language
detection, where, given an input text, the algorithm would return the langauge of the text.
